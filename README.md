# Mulch Calculator in React
This was inspired as a learning project, after I built the same project in vanilla JS, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/ChaseTramel/mulch-calculator-js).

This project is a web app built in React that takes in user input about an idea to be covered with mulch, and displays information about that area, including how many bags of mulch will be needed.

The mulch bag information can be optionally edited.

The project incorporates form components, demonstrating the use of controlled components in React. The `ResultsDisplay` component also demonstrates appropriate use of passing props, as well as using states to conditionally display information. The calculation logic is handled in a custom hook, `useCalculateMulch`.
